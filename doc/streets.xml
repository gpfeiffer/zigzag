<Heading>Set Methods for Streets.</Heading>

Streets are domains and therefore all set theoretic functions described
in  chapter "Domains"  are also  applicable to  streets.   This section
describes  which  functions  are  implemented  specially  for  streets.
Functions  not  mentioned here  are  handled  by  the default  methods
described in the respective sections of chapter "Domains".

More precisely, every street has as its operations record
<C>StreetOps</C> which inherits from <C>DomainOps</C>
and overrides the methods below to make it work or to provide 
more efficient implementations.
