Let <M>W</M> be the group of permutations of the <M>n+1</M> points
<M>\{1, 2, \dots, n+1\}</M>.  To each permutation <M>\pi \in W</M> you
can associate a <E>zigzag pattern</E><Index>zigzag pattern</Index> of
<M>n</M> ups (<M>\nearrow</M>) and downs (<M>\searrow</M>) depending
on whether <M>i^{\pi} &lt; (i+1)^{\pi}</M> or <M>i^{\pi} >
(i+1)^{\pi}</M> for <M>i \in I = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}</M>.  For example,
the permutation <Display><![CDATA[\left( \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9 \\ 3&2&8&9&4&6&1&7&5 \end{array}\right)]]></Display>
has the sequence
<Display>
\searrow\ \ \nearrow\ \ \nearrow\ \ \searrow\ \ \nearrow\ \ \searrow\ \ \nearrow\ \ \searrow
</Display>
as its zigzag pattern.  Obviously, there are <M>2^n</M> such
sequences, and every sequence occurs as a zizag pattern of some
permutation.  <P/>

Alternatively, (the list of images of) a permutation <M>\pi</M> can be
broken into longest possible descending subsequences.  The lengths of
these subsequences form a <E>composition</E> of <M>n+1</M>, which also
describes the zigzag pattern of <M>\pi</M>.  For example, the
descending subsequences of the permutation <M>\pi =
[3,2,8,9,4,6,1,7,5]</M> are <M>3,2;8;9,4;6,1;7,5</M> of lengths
<M>2,1,2,2,2</M>.  For a composition <M>q</M> of <M>n+1</M>, let
<M>Y_q</M> be the set of all permutations whose descending
subsequences have lengths <M>q</M> and let <M>y_q</M> be the sum of
the elements of <M>Y_q</M> in the (rational) group algebra of
<M>W</M>.  It is an amazing property of the elements <M>y_q</M>, where
<M>q</M> ranges over all the <M>2^n</M> compositions of <M>n+1</M>,
that they span a <E>subalgebra</E> of the group algebra.  In other
words, the product of <M>y_q</M> and <M>y_r</M>, formed inside the
group algebra of <M>W</M>, is a linear combination of elemenst
<M>y_s</M> for certain compositions <M>s</M> of <M>n+1</M>.  Atkinson
<Cite Key="Atkinson1986"/> describes the product <M>y_q y_r</M> in terms of
<M>0</M>-<M>1</M> matrices with prescribed row and column sums.  <P/>

    A <E>descent algebra</E> is primarily a subalgebra of the group
algebra of a finite Coxeter group.
