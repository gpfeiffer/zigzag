Let <M>W</M> be the group of permutations of the <M>n+1</M> points
<M>\{1, 2, \dots, n+1\}</M>.  To each permutation <M>\pi \in W</M> you
can associate a <E>zigzag pattern</E><Index>zigzag pattern</Index> of
<M>n</M> ups (<M>\nearrow</M>) and downs (<M>\searrow</M>) depending
on whether <M>i^{\pi} &lt; (i+1)^{\pi}</M> or <M>i^{\pi} >
(i+1)^{\pi}</M> for <M>i \in I = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}</M>.  For example,
the permutation <Display><![CDATA[\left( \begin{array}{ccccccccc}
1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9 \\ 3&2&8&9&4&6&1&7&5 \end{array}\right)]]></Display>
has the sequence
<Display>
\searrow\ \ \nearrow\ \ \nearrow\ \ \searrow\ \ \nearrow\ \ \searrow\ \ \nearrow\ \ \searrow
</Display>
as its zigzag pattern.  Obviously, there are <M>2^n</M> such
sequences, and every sequence occurs as a zizag pattern of some
permutation.<P/>

Alternatively, (the list of images of) a permutation <M>\pi</M> can be
broken into longest possible descending subsequences.  The lengths of
these subsequences form a <E>composition</E> of <M>n+1</M>, which also
describes the zigzag pattern of <M>\pi</M>.  For example, the
descending subsequences of the permutation <M>\pi =
[3,2,8,9,4,6,1,7,5]</M> are <M>3,2\mid8\mid9,4\mid6,1\mid7,5</M> of lengths
<M>2,1,2,2,2</M>.  For a composition <M>q</M> of <M>n+1</M>, let
<M>Y_q</M> be the set of all permutations whose descending
subsequences have lengths <M>q</M> and let <M>y_q</M> be the sum of
the elements of <M>Y_q</M> in the (rational) group algebra of
<M>W</M>.<P/>

It is an amazing property of the elements <M>y_q</M>, where
<M>q</M> ranges over all the <M>2^n</M> compositions of <M>n+1</M>,
that they span a <E>subalgebra</E> of the group algebra.  In other
words, the product of <M>y_q</M> and <M>y_r</M>, formed inside the
group algebra of <M>W</M>, is a linear combination of elements
<M>y_s</M> for certain compositions <M>s</M> of <M>n+1</M>.  Atkinson
<Cite Key="Atkinson1986"/> describes the product <M>y_q y_r</M> in terms of
<M>0</M>-<M>1</M> matrices with prescribed row and column sums.  <P/>

Even more remarkable is the fact that Solomon
<Cite Key="Solomon1976"/> originally discovered descent
algebras inside the group algebras of finite Coxeter groups.
The symmetric groups are just one type of finite Coxeter
groups.  Many properties of symmetric groups
are in some form shared by other or all
finite Coxeter groups.  Usually, such properties
are first described for symmetric groups and
then generalized to other types of finite Coxeter groups.
In the case of the descent algebras,
the general description for all
finite Coxeter groups came before the special
case of the symmetric group. <P/>
